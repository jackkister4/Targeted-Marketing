# Targeted-Marketing
This project was a report on a list of individuals who had previously been marketed to by a company, and the goal was to figure out which individuals are worth targeting again. This goal was accomplished by using principal componenet analysis, K-Nearest Neighbor classification, and agglomerative clustering.

Included is the report labeled "Jack Kister Targeted Marketing", the R script for running the analysis, and the original data set.
